    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="pics/Max.JPG">

    <p> My name is Max Diaz, and I recently earned a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Missouri-Kansas
      City (UMKC). I possess a keen interest in both frontend and backend development, utilizing HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript for frontend projects. On the backend, I am proficient in C++ and Java, often incorporating Node.js and Express for seamless backend functionality. <br><br>

      Originally pursuing studies in Civil/Mechanical Engineering, I uncovered a profound passion for computer science
      during my academic journey. My years of experience as a lead technician in production engineering have honed
      essential skills, including problem-solving, attention to detail, and effective teamwork. I am eager to apply
      these skills as I delve deeper into the realm of computer science. <br><br>

      I have actively contributed to projects that demanded expertise in both frontend and backend development,
      providing me with valuable hands-on experience. This exposure has significantly broadened my understanding of
      various programming languages and cutting-edge technologies. I am enthusiastic about tackling challenges and
      exploring innovative solutions within this dynamic field. <br><br>

      The future of computer science presents immense opportunities, and I eagerly anticipate the limitless
      possibilities it offers. I am excited to embark on this journey, contributing my skills and enthusiasm to make a
      meaningful impact in the field.
