    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="pics/Max.JPG">

    <p> My name is Max Diaz and I recently graduated from the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) with a B.S in
      Computer Science. I have an interest in both frontend and backend development, using HTML and CSS and Javascript
      for the frontend. For the backend I have experience with C++, Java using Node.js and express to work with the
      backend. While initially began school pursuing a Civil/Mechanical Engineering, I discovered my deep fascination
      for computer science. The years of experience as a lead technician in production
      engineering have equipped me with invaluable skills, such as problem-solving, attention to detail, and effective
      teamwork. I am excited to leverage this experience as I dig further into the field of computer science. <br><br>

      I have worked on projects that allow me to apply my skills on both frontend and backend development. This hands-on
      experience has been instrumental in expanding my knowledge of programming languages and
      cutting-edge technologies. I relish the opportunity to tackle challenges and explore innovative solutions within
      this dynamic field. The future in the computer science field shows tremendous opportunities, and I eagerly
      anticipate the endless possibilities it offers. I am excited to embark on this journey and contribute my skills
      and enthusiasm to making a meaningful impact in the field.
