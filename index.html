            <p> Hi. My name is Max Diaz. I am returning to school to obtain my B.S in computer science. I have an interest in both frontend and backend development. While initially began school pursuing a Civil/Mechanical Engineering, I discovered my deep fascination for computer science. Years of experience as a lead technician in production engineering have equipped me with invaluable skills, such as problem-solving, attention to detail, and effective teamwork. I am excited to leverage this experience as I dig further into the field of computer science. <br><br>      
                Currently, I am working on projects that allow me to apply my skills in both frontend and backend development. This hands-on experience has been instrumental in expanding my knowledge of programming languages and cutting-edge technologies. I relish the opportunity to tackle challenges and explore innovative solutions within this dynamic field. <br><br>
                The future in the computer science field shows tremendous opportunities, and I eagerly anticipate the endless possibilities it offers. I am excited to embark on this journey and contribute my skills and enthusiasm to making a meaningful impact in the field.

            <h1>Education Background</h1>
            <div id="educationHistory">
              <p>I started my College journey pursuing civil and Mechanical engineering back in Community College at Penn Valley and Maples Woods. I have always been interested in how things work and how they are built. I have always been a hands-on person and enjoy building things. During my time at Penn Valley, I was able to obtain my Associates in Engineering. I had the opportunity to work as a lead technician for years. I enjoyed the work, but I felt like I was missing something. I decided to go back to school and obtain my B.S in Computer Science. I am currently a student at UMKC and will be graduating in fall 2023. Since then, I have enjoyed this field better than my previous one.</p>
