              <p>I began my college journey by pursuing civil and mechanical engineering at Penn Valley and Maples Woods Community Colleges. I have always been fascinated by how things work and how they are built. Being a hands-on person, I find joy in building things. During my time at Penn Valley, I earned my Associates in Engineering. I subsequently worked as a lead technician for several years, finding satisfaction in the work. However, I felt that something was missing. This realization led me to return to school to pursue a B.S. in Computer Science, which I successfully completed at UMKC in the fall of 2023. Since then, I have found greater fulfillment in this field compared to my previous one. Here is a list of some of my academic classes I went through to odtain my degree</p>
