        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p class="introduction">I have experience in developing small-scale applications using C++ and Java, spanning
            from basic calculators to GUI-based applications. My notable projects heavily relied on Object-Oriented
            Programming principles. Most recently, I undertook a full-stack development project using Node.js and
            MongoDB.</p>

                    <h1 class="heading">SOS Game</h1>
                    <p>The SOS game is a Java application developed using Object-Oriented Programming. It allows
                        players to play a word-based game where they aim to form "SOS" sequences to earn points. The
                        game features multiple modes, customizable board sizes, and the option to play against a
                        computer. Additionally, it includes a record feature that logs players' moves and turns
                        during the game. Overall, it offers an engaging programming project that demonstrates the
                        use of Java and Object-Oriented principles in game development.</p>

                <p>TThe GTA Application System modernizes the UMKC Computer Science department's process for collecting,
                    managing, and matching Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) applications. It serves two user types:
                    students and administrators. <br>

                    Users can easily view and apply for jobs, checking application status when logged in. Administrators
                    can create, edit, and manage job postings, including changing application statuses. All data is
                    stored securely in a database. <br>

                    This full-stack development project employs Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and utilizes the EJS
                    extension with layouts for an efficient and user-friendly experience.</p>
